<p><H2>Personal History</H2></p>
<p>I grew up in a family of Faith. My parents both serve the Lord. My father spends most of his time serving the church and making bread at home instead of being a wage earner. My mother used to work as an editor, and retired early during my second year of college because of illness. Financially, far from rich in comparison with my classmates, all three of my family members live now on my mother¡¯s meager pensions in a small apartment of 47 square meters, and try to get by and make do.</p>
<p>However, I never quite considered us as being poor. Mom often said that those who are rich are those who helped others, and my family provided help to others. We opened our home to serve two days a week, which has become a routine for more than ten years. Every weekend, more than 20 Christians huddled in our small living room, worshipping and studying the Bible. My parents spent lots of time praying for and visiting the sick, mediating family disputes, helping parents with education problems with their children, and teaching people to be righteousness in their work according to the Bible. I realized that it was not money that earned them such a good reputation amongst people.</p>
<p>My family education allowed me to understand the truth taught in the Bible, ¡°It is more blessed to give than to receive.¡± I learned the way to lead a thanksgiving life with dignity and to have a strong will to be self-improved with the grace of the Lord in my whole life and to become a helper to others.</p>
<p>I made my best efforts to strive for academic excellence and acceptance at Zhejiang University, which meant placing myself among the top 1500 in all of the 60,000 senior year high school graduates in Beijing that very year. In our small apartment, I never did have a room of my own, and there were always quite a few others who assembled there to study the Bible during the weekends. However, such a challenging environment brought me a character of self-discipline. This diligence has been retained throughout my college education, ensuring an excellent performance at Zhejiang University, and I believe I will continue to work hard in every environment. </p>
<p>At church, I¡¯ve always tried my best to help others despite my limited strength and resources. I also shared my own experience and studying methods with my peers and other youths to help them in the College Entrance Examination. Being a helper allows me to love others and be loved by them. I gained true joy from being filled with love, not just because I am loved by others, but more because I love them.</p>
<p>I truly wish to obtain real wealth in my heart by helping others in the future. I believe that I can improve my capability and benefit even more people by mastering advanced technology. As a field of technology that is enjoying a strongest magnitude in prosperity, Computer Science is my best choice. Therefore, I would like to apply for the master¡¯s program in Computer Science at your university so as to seek further improvement in my skills.</p>
